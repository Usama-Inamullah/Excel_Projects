## EXCEL PROJECT.pdf

Excited to present an interactive dashboard built in Excel for tracking and analyzing key metrics from a Hospital Emergency Room.

🔍 Key Insights Included: 
✅ Total Number of Patients
✅ Average Wait Time
✅ Admission Status Overview
✅ Age Group Distribution
✅ Gender Analysis
✅ Department Referrals
✅ Percentage Seen Within 30 Minutes

💡 This dashboard updates dynamically using pivot tables, slicers, and charts, allowing users to slice data by month, gender, and more—right inside Excel.

📌 Created entirely in Excel to demonstrate that powerful, interactive dashboards don’t always need fancy tools. Good ol’ Excel can do wonders!
